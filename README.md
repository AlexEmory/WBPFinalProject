COSC 484 Final Project
By: Alexandra Emory

To set up and run the project locally you must go to both client and server folder and run 'npm start' on both of them.
You must then, in a web browser, navigate to localhost:4200 as that is where the client is deployed. The server is deployed on port 3000, 
but it doesn't need to be open in the browser for the application to run. 

Each User Stories Completed:
1. As a basic user, I would like to display the current weather, so I may know what the weather is like outside.
2. As a casual user, I would like to display the current 'feels like' temperature, so I may know what to wear outside.
3. As a user, I want to know the precipitation rate, so I can prepare for any rainy conditions.
4. As a user, I want to check humidity, so that my hair is prepared accordingly.
5. As a user, I want to know the wind speeds, so I may know to bring a wind jacket.
6. As a very pale person, I want to know the UV Index, so I know if I need to put on sunscreen or not.
